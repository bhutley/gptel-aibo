# gptel-aibo

[**Breaking Changes**](#breaking-changes)

**gptel-aibo** is an AI writing assistant system built on top of
[gptel](https://github.com/karthink/gptel) .
It helps you create and manage content in Emacs, including code, documents, and
even fiction, along with many other possibilities. As you talk to the LLM, it
automatically sends the content (or a portion of it) that you're currently
working on, allowing you to refer to elements like "this function," "this class,"
or "this file," etc. It also defines an action set and its format with the LLM,
so once a response is received, you can easily apply the suggestions with a single
command (`gptel-aibo-apply-last-suggestions`, bound to `C-c !`).

While you can chat with the LLM for complex tasks, when your context is clear
enough, you can use the quick command `gptel-aibo-summon` to invoke the LLM to
generate appropriate content right at your cursor position. If the newly
inserted content has direct implications for the next few lines, the LLM will
adjust them accordingly. All these changes will be displayed using an in-place
diff format. If you accept these inputs, the LLM can even predict what comes
next. At any point, you can press Enter to accept suggestions or Esc to dismiss
them.

The term *aibo*, meaning partner, is currently ambiguous‚Äîit could refer to
gptel‚Äôs partner, or the user‚Äôs.

## Installation
This package requires [gptel](https://github.com/karthink/gptel) and access to any
LLM through it. See its README for details on setting up your LLM environment.

`gptel-aibo` is available on MELPA. If you have MELPA already set up, you can
install it using `package-install`, or by adding the following to your configuration:
```elisp
(use-package gptel-aibo :ensure t)
```

### Doom Emacs
In your `packages.el`, add this line:
```elisp
(package! gptel-aibo)
```
**Note**: In the `gptel-aibo` interface, it overrides the `flycheck` keybinding
`C-c !` (you generally won't need to use `flycheck` in the `gptel-aibo`
interface, especially with the shortcut key). Therefore, if you want to
configure further using `use-package!`, make sure `gptel-aibo` is loaded after 
`flycheck`.
```elisp
(use-package! gptel-aibo
  :after (gptel flycheck))
```
Alternatively, define a different keybinding:
```elisp
(use-package! gptel-aibo
  :after (gptel)
  :config
  (define-key gptel-aibo-mode-map
              (kbd "C-c /") #'gptel-aibo-apply-last-suggestions))
```

## Usage
### `gptel-aibo`
With the `gptel-aibo` interactive command, you can open or switch to an existing
`gptel-aibo` console, which is a `markdown` page with the `gptel-aibo` minor
mode enabled, an extension of `gptel-mode`.

To get started, open your file, move the cursor to the section you're working
on, or even start from a project-related buffer, such as the compilation buffer,
and then switch to the gptel-aibo console. There, you can talk to the LLM
and receive suggestions. Use `gptel-aibo-send` to send your request, which is
bound to `C-c RET`, just like the send command in `gptel-mode`.

Once a response is received, you can apply it using the command 
`gptel-aibo-apply-last-suggestions` (bound to `C-c !`), or continue the
conversation with more detailed instructions.

There is also a custom variable, `gptel-aibo-auto-apply`. When set, gptel-aibo
will automatically apply the LLM‚Äôs response to your project after receiving it.
This makes gptel-aibo function like the aider‚Äôs no-auto-commits. Use it carefully!

### `gptel-aibo-summon`
Note: This command deprecates the old `gptel-aibo-complete-at-point`.

While you can chat with the LLM for complex tasks, when your context is clear
enough, you can use the quick command `gptel-aibo-summon` to invoke the LLM to
generate appropriate content right at your cursor position. If the newly
inserted content has direct implications for the next few lines, the LLM will
adjust them accordingly. All these changes will be displayed using an in-place
diff format. If you accept these inputs, the LLM can even predict what comes
next. At any point, you can press Enter to accept suggestions or Esc to dismiss
them.

You can bind the command to a proper shortcut key, for example:
- Doom Emacs
```elisp
(use-package! gptel-aibo
  :after (gptel flycheck)
  :config
  (map! :map prog-mode-map "C-i" #'gptel-aibo-summon))
```
- Vanilla Emacs
```elisp
(use-package gptel-aibo
  :after (gptel flycheck)
  :config
  (define-key prog-mode-map (kbd "C-i") #'gptel-aibo-summon))
```


## Samples
### Query the logic, request additional cases

### Refactor a sample project
*NOTE*: Tasks like refactoring, which involve multiple files, require you to
set `gptel-aibo-max-buffer-count` to a larger value, such as 5. In the long run,
this inconvenience will be eliminated through a more automated approach, like
tool calling.

### Other common tasks & ideas
- generate a docstring for this function
- make the comment conform to Doxygen style
- generate the code for this function based on the comments (better done with
`gptel-aibo-summon`)
- refactor this function and reorganize its logic
- reformat this function, as some lines are too long
- extract the common parts of functions A and B into a new function
- change the coding style from snake_case to camelCase (or vice versa)

## Customization
- `gptel-aibo-max-buffer-size`

  The size limit for the buffers that is automatically sent to the LLM.
  
  If the working buffer (the buffer you are currently working on) exceeds this
  size, only a fragment of content around the cursor (typically a function or
  class) will be sent.

  For other buffers in the same project: if their size exceeds this limit and
  they have an outline available, only the outline will be sent. Otherwise,
  their content will not be sent.

  The default value is 16000.

- `gptel-aibo-max-buffer-count`
  
  The maximum number of buffers within the same project as your working buffer
  that are automatically sent to the LLM.
  
  The default value is 2.

- `gptel-aibo-default-mode`

  Functions similarly to `gptel-default-mode`; when set, it takes precedence
  over the latter.
- `gptel-aibo-prompt-prefix-alist`

  Functions similarly to `gptel-default-mode`; when set, it takes precedence
  over the latter.

### Face Settings
- `gptel-aibo-op-display`

  Currently, the `<OP>` marker is displayed as the character üèπ in the
  gptel-aibo console. If you prefer a different symbol, you can define another
  one, choose different characters for different operations, or even disable it
  entirely.
- `gptel-aibo-op-face`

  This setting controls the face for OP action names, such as `MODIFY`, `CREATE`,
  and `DELETE`. You can customize it, or even set different faces for different
  actions.

  For more details, check out `gptel-aibo-face.el`.

## Miscellaneous
To make the gptel-aibo console look a bit fancier, I copied the following
markdown configuration from this Reddit post
[beautify_markdown_on_emacs](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/10h9jf0/beautify_markdown_on_emacs/).
Thanks to the original author!

If you like it, you can add it to your configuration file.
```elisp
(after! markdown-mode
  (custom-set-faces!
    '(markdown-header-delimiter-face :foreground "#616161" :height 0.9)
    '(markdown-header-face-1 :height 1.8 :foreground "#A3BE8C" :weight extra-bold :inherit markdown-header-face)
    '(markdown-header-face-2 :height 1.4 :foreground "#EBCB8B" :weight extra-bold :inherit markdown-header-face)
    '(markdown-header-face-3 :height 1.2 :foreground "#D08770" :weight extra-bold :inherit markdown-header-face)
    '(markdown-header-face-4 :height 1.15 :foreground "#BF616A" :weight bold :inherit markdown-header-face)
    '(markdown-header-face-5 :height 1.1 :foreground "#b48ead" :weight bold :inherit markdown-header-face)
    '(markdown-header-face-6 :height 1.05 :foreground "#5e81ac" :weight semi-bold :inherit markdown-header-face)))
```

## Security issues
1. The file path and content of the current working buffer, as well as buffers
from the same project, may be sent to the LLM.
2. There are three actions defined in `gptel-aibo`: modification, creation,
and deletion. These actions are only allowed if the target is under the project
root of the current working buffer. If a buffer is not part of a project,
only modifications to itself can be executed.
3. Modifications and creations are saved immediately after they are applied,
with an additional confirmation required for deletion. While some changes can be
reverted using Emacs‚Äô undo system, it‚Äôs best to place your project under version
control to enhance safety and recoverability.

## Breaking Changes

1. To align with MELPA naming conventions, the initial draft prefix `gptai` has
been changed to the official `gptel-aibo`.
  - interactive command `gptai` ‚Üí `gptel-aibo`
  - `gptai-apply-last-suggestions` ‚Üí `gptel-aibo-apply-last-suggestions`
  - `gptai-mode-map` ‚Üí `gptel-aibo-mode-map`
  - `gptai-complete-at-point` ‚Üí `gptel-aibo-complete-at-point`
  - `gptai-complete-mode-map` ‚Üí `gptel-aibo-complete-mode-map`
2. The variable `gptai--max-buffer-size` has been renamed to 
`gptel-aibo-max-buffer-size`.
3. The variable `gptai--max-project-buffer-size` has been removed. Both the
working buffer and the project buffers are now controlled by
`gptel-aibo-max-buffer-size`.
4. The variable `gptai--max-project-buffer-count` has been renamed to 
`gptel-aibo-max-buffer-count`.
